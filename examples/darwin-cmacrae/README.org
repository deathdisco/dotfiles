  A collection of Darwin machine configurations - expressed in [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]] - leveraging [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][LnL7/nix-darwin]] & [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][rycee/home-manager]]

** Initial rebuild needs explicit ~darwin-config~ target
   #+begin_src shell
   $ darwin-rebuild switch \
         -I darwin-config=$HOME/dev/config/machines/<target system>/configuration.nix
   #+end_src
   /Note: <target system> here should point to the relevant directory for the system to build/

   ~environment.darwinConfig~ should also be updated to reflect the path.

   After this, ~darwin-rebuild~ will just point at this configuration naturally.
