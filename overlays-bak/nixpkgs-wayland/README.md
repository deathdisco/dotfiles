## Overview

Automated, pre-built packages for Wayland (sway/wlroots) tools for NixOS.

There is [a changelog available](./CHANGELOG.md).

These packages can be used by Nix users on other distros as well. For an example, see [the Ubuntu demo](docs/sway-on-ubuntu) for more information.

Packages from this overlay are regularly updated and built against `nixos-unstable`. They are published to the binary cache on Cachix. Usage instructions are available on the Cachix page: [`nixpkgs-wayland` on cachix](https://nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org).

These packages were mostly recently built against:

## Usage

Continue reading for usage instructions on NixOS (only the `nixos-unstable` channel is supported!).

You can also use this [with Nix on Ubuntu. Please see the full walkthrough](docs/sway-on-ubuntu/).

### Usage (nixos-unstable)

This usage just utilizes [`overlay` functionality from `nixpkgs`]().

Note that when using the overlay, the module will automatically reference the correct
`sway` package since the newer package is overlayed ontop of `pkgs`.

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
let
  url = "https://github.com/colemickens/nixpkgs-wayland/archive/master.tar.gz";
  waylandOverlay = (import (builtins.fetchTarball url));
in
  {
    nixpkgs.overlays = [ waylandOverlay ];
    programs.sway.enable = true;
    programs.sway.extraPackages = with pkgs; [
      xwayland
      swaybg   # required by sway for controlling desktop wallpaper
      swayidle # used for controlling idle timeouts and triggers (screen locking, etc)
      swaylock # used for locking Wayland sessions

      waybar        # polybar-alike
      i3status-rust # simpler bar written in Rust

      gebaar-libinput  # libinput gestures utility
      glpaper          # GL shaders as wallpaper
      grim             # screen image capture
      kanshi           # dynamic display configuration helper
      mako             # notification daemon
      oguri            # animated background utility
      redshift-wayland # patched to work with wayland gamma protocol
      slurp            # screen area selection tool
      waypipe          # network transparency for Wayland
      wf-recorder      # wayland screenrecorder
      wl-clipboard     # clipboard CLI utilities
      wtype            # xdotool, but for wayland

      # TODO: more steps required to use this?
      xdg-desktop-portal-wlr # xdg-desktop-portal backend for wlroots
    ];
    environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
      # other compositors/window-managers
      waybox   # An openbox clone on Wayland
      bspwc    # Wayland compositor based on BSPWM
      cage     # A Wayland kiosk (runs a single app fullscreen)

      wayfire   # 3D wayland compositor
      wf-config # wayfire config manager
    ];
  }
```

### Usage (wlrobs)

OBS Studio Plugins don't really fit into any NixOS infrastructure, so we'll
follow the instructions provided by.

Note, these instructions can probably be simplified to just consume a latest snapshot of this repo, rather than cloning the repo at a point in time:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays
git clone https://github.com/colemickens/nixpkgs-wayland ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays/nixpkgs-wayland
nix-env -iA wlrobs
mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio
ln -s ~/.nix-profile/share/obs/obs-plugins ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins
```

NOTE: OBS-Studio is pretty rough around the edges in Wayland, regardless of if XWayland is used. `wf-recorder` might be easier to use.

### Quick Tips: `sway`

* Usage of display managers with `sway` is not supported upstream, you should run it from a TTY.
* You will likely want a default config file to place at `$HOME/.config/sway/config`. You can use the upstream default as a starting point: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/config.in

## Development Guide

#### Building

1. Install `nix`.
2. Run `nix-build build.nix -A nixosUnstable` to build the packages against current `nixos-unstable`.
3. Run `nix-build build.nix -A nixpkgsUnstable` to build them against `nixpkgs-unstable`.

Do note that those channels are actually pinned in this repo. The update script will also update those
refs. Making sure the channels are up-to-date means that you will be building the packages that are going
to be requested by users on those channels (who are up-to-date on the channel).

#### Updating all packages

* `./update.sh`:
  * updates `pkgs/<pkg>/metadata.nix` with the latest commit+hash for each package
  * updates `nixpkgs/<channel>/metadata.nix` per the upstream channel
  * calls `nix-build build.nix -A all` to build all packages against both channels
  * pushes to [nixpkgs-wayland on cachix](https://nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org)

Note: in some cases, you may need to manually update `cargoSha256` as well.
